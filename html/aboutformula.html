						What we do…
						<br>
						<br>
						Cyclone Racing’s Formula Team designs, builds, tests, and races a formula style race car each year to compete with approximately 450 teams from all around the world at several Formula SAE Series events. Most aspects of being a professional racing team are evaluated and judged, and the team operates largely from private sponsorship with support from Iowa State University. Teams must demonstrate a top-performing racing machine on the track, and also demonstrate their working knowledge in engineering and marketing through a series of presentation events. Cyclone Racing Formula competes in many different events all across the country and even in Canada.
						<br>
						If you are wondering why we do this, the answer is simple. We have fun! As future professionals we appreciate taking the extra effort to gain real-world experience and learn about new, cutting-edge technologies that deal with the design, manufacturing, and testing of a race car. We do not receive credit and usually find ourselves spending more time on the car than in the classroom. The experiences and friends gained through such a team are invaluable to our futures. The only requirements for members is that they be students; all majors are welcome!
